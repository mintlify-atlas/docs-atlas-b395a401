## On-Chain Verification

<Info>
The deployed program is verified on-chain with hash:

You can verify the program deployment using Solana's verification tools to ensure the on-chain code matches the audited source code.

## Continuous Security

Privacy Cash maintains a strong security posture through:

- **Multiple Independent Audits**: Six separate security firms have reviewed the codebase
- **On-Chain Verification**: Program hash verification ensures deployed code matches audited code
- **Open Source**: All code is publicly available for community review
- **Regular Updates**: Security patches and improvements based on audit findings

<Warning>
While the protocol has been thoroughly audited, users should always exercise caution when interacting with DeFi protocols. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
</Warning>
