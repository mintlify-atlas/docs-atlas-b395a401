description: Overview of Privacy Cash deployment process and environments
---

Privacy Cash can be deployed to different Solana networks depending on your needs. This section covers the complete deployment workflow from building to verification.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Privacy Cash, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Solana CLI** 2.1.18 or later
- **Rust** 1.79.0 or compatible version
- **Anchor** 0.31.1
- **Node.js** 16 or later
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Circom** v2.2.2 - [Installation guide](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/#installing-dependencies)

## Deployment Environments

Privacy Cash supports deployment to multiple Solana networks:

### Devnet
Development and testing environment. Use this for:
- Testing new features
- Integration testing
- Development workflows

**Program ID**: `ATZj4jZ4FFzkvAcvk27DW9GRkgSbFnHo49fKKPQXU7VS`

### Mainnet
Production environment for live applications.

**Program ID**: `9fhQBbumKEFuXtMBDw8AaQyAjCorLGJQiS3skWZdQyQD`

<Note>
The mainnet program is fully audited by Accretion, HashCloak, Zigtur and Kriko, and verified onchain with hash `c6f1e5336f2068dc1c1e1c64e92e3d8495b8df79f78011e2620af60aa43090c5`.
</Note>

## Deployment Workflow

The typical deployment process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Build the Program">
    Compile the Solana program using Anchor with appropriate feature flags for your target environment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy to Network">
    Deploy the compiled program to devnet or mainnet using Anchor or Solana CLI.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Initialize Program State">
    Run initialization scripts to set up Merkle trees and configuration accounts.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Deployment">
    Verify the program build matches the deployed bytecode for transparency.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Program Configuration

The program configuration is managed in `anchor/Anchor.toml`:

```toml
[programs.devnet]
zkcash = "ATZj4jZ4FFzkvAcvk27DW9GRkgSbFnHo49fKKPQXU7VS"

[programs.mainnet]
zkcash = "9fhQBbumKEFuXtMBDw8AaQyAjCorLGJQiS3skWZdQyQD"
```

## Keypair Management

<Warning>
Keep your deployment keypairs secure. Never commit `deploy-keypair.json` or `zkcash-keypair.json` to version control.
</Warning>

Deployment requires two keypairs:

- **deploy-keypair.json**: Pays for deployment transactions and initializes the program
- **zkcash-keypair.json**: The program's keypair that determines its address
